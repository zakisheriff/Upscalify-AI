# Upscalify AI — operating context for agents

Read this before touching the code. It describes what exists, what is stubbed,
and what is deliberately deferred, so you can work without re-deriving the
project from scratch. `CLAUDE.md` holds the same context with more of the "why".

## What this is

An image and video upscaler from The Atom. Upload a low-res file, reconstruct a
sharper higher-res version, compare before/after, download. v1 runs entirely on
the local machine. Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, vanilla CSS, GSAP + Framer
Motion.

## The one seam that matters

`lib/upscale.ts` → `upscale(file, options)` is the only entry the frontend uses.
It hides that v1 posts to a local API route and polls job status. Do not let
UI code learn where inference runs. Server-side, `lib/inference/backend.ts` →
`getBackend(kind)` picks the backend; a cloud phase slots in here via
`INFERENCE_URL` with no change above it.

## Built vs stubbed

- **Fully working**: image upscaling (sharp), video upscaling with preserved
  audio and real progress (ffmpeg), upload → progress → compare → download,
  before/after slider, error handling, all SEO/AEO files. Verified end-to-end
  against the running server.
- **Present but inactive by default**: the remote model-server client
  (`remote-image.ts`). It activates only when `INFERENCE_URL` is set. There is
  no Real-ESRGAN/SeedVR2 server bundled — the local fallback stands in for the
  models with the same interface and scale factors.

## Intentionally deferred (cloud phase)

- Hosting the inference layer remotely. The seam (`getBackend` / `INFERENCE_URL`)
  is ready; the model server and its NDJSON progress contract are not built.
- Persistent storage / a real job store (currently filesystem + in-memory Map).
- Anything auth, billing, queue, or multi-user. Out of scope for v1 by design.

## Known constraints

- Video needs `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH. `sharp` is bundled and marked a
  server-external package in `next.config.ts`.
- Job state lives in the running process; restarting the server drops jobs.
- Image limit 30 MB, video 500 MB (`lib/media.ts`).
- Local fallback clamps output pixels to keep single-machine processing sane.

## House rules (enforced)

Sentence case; no emojis, decorative icons, arrows, eyebrows, bright gradients,
or filler lists. Inputs ≥16px. Reduced motion respected. GSAP and Framer Motion
never animate the same element. Commit + push after every meaningful change with
lowercase conventional messages and no attribution lines.
